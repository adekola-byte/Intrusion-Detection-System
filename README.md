# Intrusion-Detection-System
Welcome to my Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project utilizing the big data capabilities of Apache Spark. This repository contains code for three main components of the system:

1. **Baseline Model**: A baseline model for data analysis and comparison to measure the performance improvements achieved by the binary and multiclass classification models.

2. **Binary Classification Model**: A binary classification model to detect and classify network intrusions as either normal or malicious.

3. **Multiclass Classification Model**: A multiclass classification model to categorize network intrusions into various predefined attack types.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run and experiment with the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Apache Spark (version 3.4.1)
- Python
- Hadoop
- Java JDK
- Anaconda (optional but recommended)
- Jupyter Labs (optional but recommended)

**Usage**
Navigate to the specific folder for the component you want to use (e.g., baseline-model, binary-classification, or multiclass-classification).

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script associated with the component you wish to work with.

Follow the instructions and comments within the code to analyze and experiment with the dataset and model.

**Data**
The data used in this project is not included in this repository due to its size. You can obtain the dataset from https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/2DhnLGDdEECo4ys?path=%2FUNSW-NB15%20-%20CSV%20Files and place it in the data directory within each component's folder.
